## Hi 👋 I am Luis! 
I'm a Software Developer and college student who loves learning how technology works and building stuff with it

### 🔨 Projects I'm the most proud of
<ul>
<li>
<b>Contact-hub</b> 
<p>As part of my on-campus job, I colaborating on a PHP-based web application called "Contact Hub" using the SCRUM framework. The application functions as a centralized platform for ITESM campuses information that provides comprehensive details on academic programs, student life, admission requirements, and campus options to attract potential students.</p>
</li>
<li>
<b>Peer learning-app</b>
<p>The project is a peer-learning web application connecting student mentors to fellow students in need of tutoring. It consists of two single-page applications using Firebase for hosting, database, and storage. One app uses Angular, the other Vue.js, both styled with Tailwind CSS. Students can search for mentors by subject and day, and approach them at a designated spot on campus. The app has connected over 2500 students and mentors.</p>
 It's still under development but you can visit the currently deployed version at <a href="https://biblioteca.maes.mx/#/">Biblioteca MAE</a> and <a href="https://maes.mx/#/">maes.mx</a>!
